### BI Exercise - Office Space Optimization
This is the exercise I prepared for a data analyst role. The data was given as fictitous data that represents I might encounter in the role. I was encouraged to explore the data and provide as many insights as I wish, and also use the creaticity in how I would present the data to a customer who has zero data literacy. The PDF version of the report can be accessed [here](https://github.com/zirongl/zirongl/blob/main/Examples/Office%20Space%20Optimization_pbi_example.pdf).
