## Artificial Intelligence Project
### Credit Card Fraud Detection
Western University COMPSCI 9542 Final Project

In response to the global challenge posed by credit card fraud, which incurs significant financial losses, this study explores the efficacy of integrating advanced machine learning techniques into fraud detection systems. Traditional detection methods, which often fall short against sophisticated and evolving fraud strategies, are enhanced by a suite of machine learning models, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and deep neural networks. These models are chosen for their ability to handle large, imbalanced datasets and their proficiency in recognizing subtle patterns indicative of fraudulent activity.

## Reinforcement learning Project
### Multiple Stock Trading System
Western University COMPSCI 9170 Final Project

Our study explores the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize automated trading systems for the U.S. stock market, using a dataset of hourly historical stock data from Kaggle. We evaluate the performance and adaptability of three RL algorithms: Advantage Actor Critic (A2C), Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), through a training and trading phase to test on unseen data. In particular, PPO shows a promising balance between stability and adaptability, which is essential in the volatile stock market, while DDPG shows better stability and A2C is promising in terms of earnings. Our research suggests that an ensemble approach may yield more robust trading strategies, and future work should focus on hybrid models, improved exploration techniques, and the incorporation of complex market indicators to improve the effectiveness of RL models in real-world trading applications.

## Statistical Learning Project
### Statistical Analysis on Factors Influencing Life Expectancy
Western University MDA 9159 Final Project

The Kaggle data originates from two significant sources: the Global Health Observatory (GHO)
data repository, a division of the World Health Organization (WHO), and economic data from the
United Nations. The data is concentrated on the years 2000 to 2015, a pivotal period for healthcare
development. In total, it compiles information on 193 countries, resulting in a dataset with 22
columns and 2938 rows. These columns encompass various aspects, such as life expectancy, health
factors, and economic indicators, categorized under headings like immunization, mortality,
economy, and social factors.

## Microsoft Power BI / Data Visualization
### BI Exercise - Office Space Optimization
This is the exercise I prepared for a data analyst role. The data was given as fictitous data that represents I might encounter in the role. I was encouraged to explore the data and provide as many insights as I wish, and also use the creaticity in how I would present the data to a customer who has zero data literacy. The PDF version of the report can be accessed [here](https://github.com/zirongl/zirongl/blob/main/Examples/Office%20Space%20Optimization_pbi_example.pdf).

Exercise Questions:
1. What is the average, max and all-time peak occupancy the busiest day for the Pension Department.
2. What room type and size is most used.
3. How many and what spaces in teh portfolio are never used.
